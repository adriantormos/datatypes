# datatypes

A repository with specific data types implemented in Python for the needs of personal projects. It contains:

- `collections/cyclic_list.py`: An implementation of a list that allows indices greater than its length by looping, `CyclicList`.
- `geometry/vector.py`: Implementations of 2-dimensional points and vectors (`Point2D` and `Vector2D`), with functionalities like addition, scalar multiplication, vector rotation, cartesian and polar forms...
- `geometry/segment.py`: Implementation of a 2-dimensional line segment, `Segment2D`, which allows computing intersection. 

The types are documented and tests also provide examples of functionality.
